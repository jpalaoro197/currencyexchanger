# _Currency_exchanger_

#### By _**Jacob Palaoro**_

#### _Description_

This is my week 6 epicodus project focused on api calls and using seperated js logic brought together with a static method. this is a currency exchange app that will take your entered US dollar and exchange it for different currency. It is expandable with what is included in the ExchangeRate API by adding in index.html.
